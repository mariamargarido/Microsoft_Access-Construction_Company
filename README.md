# Microsoft_Access-Construction_Company
A database was developed using Microsoft Access for the fictional company "Construções Europa", with the major goal of optimizing internal processes and supporting strategic business growth. This project was designed to:

- Increase business volume; 
- Improve the management of customer complaints; 
- Efficiently organize and handle the company’s large data volume; 
- Store and maintain detailed information about employees, projects, and clients; 
- Anticipate and mitigate operational challenges.

The development of the database followed a methodology, which included:

1. Identification of key entities: Core business elements (such as employees, projects, and clients) were analyzed, and specific tables were created for each entity to ensure data organization and integrity. 

2. Creation of intuitive forms: User-friendly forms were implemented to facilitate data input, retrieval, and updates, ensuring ease of use for end-users. 

3. Customized queries: Queries were designed to extract relevant information for analysis, such as project performance, employee birthdays for a specified month or a list of projects associated with each client.

4. Automated reports: Reports were generated to present data in a clear and accessible format, aiding strategic and operational decision-making. 

5. Definition of relationships: Accurate relationships between tables were established to ensure data integrity and consistency, eliminating redundancies and optimizing information retrieval. 

This integrated system provides the company with a powerful tool to enhance operational efficiency, reduce costs, and make informed decisions based on data. The database serves as a foundation for addressing current challenges and preparing "Construções Europa" for sustainable growth in the future.
